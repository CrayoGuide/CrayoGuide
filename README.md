I built this webpage (https://crayoguide.github.io/CrayoGuide/) to inform people about the ways you can leverage AI to autmate your income!

Iâ€™m a computer science student currently working on learning the basics and I thought creating a web page would be a good way to apply html and css and use Github for the first time
If youre thinking about getting into tech I think jumping right in and building is the best way to learn
Good luck everyone!
